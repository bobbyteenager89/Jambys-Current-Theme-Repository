# Jambys Theme

This theme stores front-end assets in organized subfolders:

- `assets/scripts/` – shared JavaScript assets
- `assets/styles/` – shared stylesheets
- `assets/experiments/<name>/` – experiment-specific scripts and styles (e.g., `assets/experiments/proteus/`, `assets/experiments/dtc/`)

Each custom script or style includes a header comment describing its purpose. New assets should follow this structure and include similar documentation.

Run `npm test` to verify the placeholder test script.
